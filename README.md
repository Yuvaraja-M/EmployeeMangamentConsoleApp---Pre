This C++ project is an Employee Management Application with basic CRUD operations. It uses file handling to store employee records and offers a menu-driven 
interface for tasks such as displaying all employees, filtering by department or age, searching, updating, deleting, adding, and calculating average salaries.
The program uses a text file ("Employee.txt") to persistently store data.

Overall, this project serves as a simple yet functional console-based employee management system with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
